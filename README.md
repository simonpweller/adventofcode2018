# adventofcode2018

This is a repo where I keep my solutions for https://adventofcode.com/2018

To get the solution for part y of day x for the input.txt inside the days folder use npm start x y. For example npm start 13 2 will return the solution for day 13 part 2 based on the input.txt inside the day13 folder.

Run the tests with npm test (after running npm install)
